# Stock Price Prediction Using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to predict stock prices using a machine learning model implemented in TensorFlow. We use historical stock data to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict future stock prices.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset of stock prices (`all_stocks_5yr.csv`).
- `models/`: Contains the trained LSTM model in `.h5` format.
- `src/`: Contains Python scripts for training and predicting stock prices.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for model training and visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
